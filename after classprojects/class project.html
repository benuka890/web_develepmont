            <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). With few
            exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce
            sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade,
            meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of
            which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been
            estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in)
            to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming
            intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviour is known as
            ethology.

                            The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the
                            domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
                            hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the
                            development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a
                            starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
                            
                            Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in
                            shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house
                            around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior
                            sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,
                            pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.
